# Bitfinex Long Vs Short script by @whalepoolbtc - https://whalepool.io   

Tired of the mis information out there regarding people's analysis and understanding of the bitfinex long/short data - I create this script so people can better get an understanding of the numbers and what they mean.  
  
It's not pretty, but it works.  
  
## Todo (someone else not me !)
If anyones feeling keen and enthusiastic, they could... 
- Put the tickers you want to fetch the data for into a dict/list, maybe build the list from an api query
- Put in api requests into a function to handle/wait upon api limit errors
- Query the coinmarketcap api, `https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/?limit=0` and add another column of data for total supply/circulating supply and the % of the tickers long/short delta relative to the total circulating supply
- Save the data hourly to mongo so it can be plotted at some point in the future over price etc
