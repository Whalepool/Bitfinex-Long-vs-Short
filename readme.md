# Bitfinex Long Vs Short script by @whalepoolbtc - https://whalepool.io   

Tired of the mis information out there regarding people's analysis and understanding of the bitfinex long/short data - I create thie script so people can better get an understanding of the numbers and what they mean.  
  
It's not pretty, but it works.  
  
If anyone wanted to, they could put the tickers in a list so more could be added on.
The timer delays are to stop the api limit errors, which there is no error handling for ofc.
